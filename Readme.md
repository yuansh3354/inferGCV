# scEAPA: evaluate anomaly pathway activity status of cancer cells in scRNA-seq <img src="logo.jpeg" width="280px" align="right" />
As a core of tumor niche, our understanding of functional programs and the nature of cancer cells remains rudimentary. One of the main reasons is transcriptional heterogeneity in cancer cells are much higher than non-cancer cells limited researchers to further explore the molecular basis and subtype of specific cancer and the progression trajectory of cancer cell. Although, a common approach to discriminate cancer cells from normal cells is the identification of copy number variation, we cannot get more information to cluster hidden subcluster of cancer cells to understand the biology diversity of tumors.  The need is especially acute for new data analysis approach to unlock the secrets of cancer cells at the single cell level. Here, we present scEAPA, a transfer learning approach to evaluate anomaly pathway activity (APA) status of cancer cells in scRNA-seq. scEAPA leverages knowledge from RNA-seq, using convolutional neural network to evaluate APA status information in RNA-seq, simultaneously, to embed scRNA-seq to screen each cellâ€™s APA status. In public scRNA-seq datasets of various human cancer types, we demonstrate that scEAPA can catch the weak signals of anomaly pathway activity and discover that pathway burden index calculated by scEAPA is highly correlated with immune-derived tumor cells in melanoma, lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Collectively, scEAPA provides an innovative approach that focuses on a more comprehensive understanding of the cluster of cancer cells in tumor research.
