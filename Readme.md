# scEAPA: evaluate anomaly pathway activity status of cancer cells in scRNA-seq <img src="logo.jpeg" width="280px" align="right" />
As a core of tumor niche, our understanding of functional programs and the nature of cancer cells remains rudimentary. One of the main reasons is transcriptional heterogeneity in cancer cells are much higher than non-cancer cells limited researchers to further explore the molecular basis and subtype of specific cancer and the progression trajectory of cancer cell. Although, a common approach to discriminate cancer cells from normal cells is the identification of copy number variation, we cannot get more information to cluster hidden subcluster of cancer cells to understand the biology diversity of tumors.  The need is especially acute for new data analysis approach to unlock the secrets of cancer cells at the single cell level.
