# sceAPA: evaluate anomaly pathway activity status of cancer cells in scRNA-seq <img src="logo.jpeg" width="280px" align="right" />
As a core of the tumor niche, our understanding of functional programs and the nature of cancer cells remains rudimentary. One of the main reasons is strong transcriptional heterogeneity in cancer cells is much higher than that in non-cancer cells, which is kept researchers from further exploring the molecular basis and subtype of specific cancer as well as the progression trajectory of cancer cells. Although, a common approach to discriminate cancer cells from normal cells is identifying copy number variation, we cannot get more information from that to cluster hidden subclusters of cancer cells and to further understand the biological diversity of tumors. Therefore, the need is especially acute for new data analysis approach to unlock the secrets of cancer cells at the single-cell level.

Here, we present sceAPA, a transfer learning approach to evaluate anomaly pathway activity (APA) status of cancer cells in scRNA-seq. sceAPA leverages knowledge from RNA-seq, using convolutional neural network to evaluate APA status information in RNA-seq, simultaneously, to embed scRNA-seq to screen each cellâ€™s APA status. In public scRNA-seq datasets of various human cancer types, we demonstrate that sceAPA can catch the weak signals of APA and discover that APA burden index calculated by sceAPA is highly correlated with immune-derived tumor cells in melanoma, lung cancer and colorectal cancer. Collectively, sceAPA provides an innovative approach that focuses on a more comprehensive understanding of the cluster of cancer cells in tumor research.
